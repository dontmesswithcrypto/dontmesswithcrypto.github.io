## Don't Mess with Crypto

[Donate](dontmesswithcrypto.actblue.com)

This site is dedicated to the proposition that all Americans have the right to communicate privately, and this is a right that we should defend. Today, that right is threatened by two draft bills that are being debated in the U.S. Senate: the [Law Enforcement Access to Encrypted Data](https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/press/rep/releases/graham-cotton-blackburn-introduce-balanced-solution-to-bolster-national-security-end-use-of-warrant-proof-encryption-that-shields-criminal-activity) (LEAED) Act, and the [EARN-IT](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/3398/text) Act. 

These two bills, if passed by Congress and signed into law, would make it difficult impossible for U.S. communications providers to deploy end-to-end encryption technology, such as the technology used in modern phones, and communications systems such as WhatsApp, Signal, Facetime, and Apple iMessage. They would require providers to degrade this technology to the point where it may no longer provide security for our communications.

To the U.S. Senators backing this legislation, the calculation is clear. They believe that the technology and privacy communities are impotent: that we will complain online, and donate to our think tanks, but there will be no electoral consequences for backing a movement to strip Americans of their privacy. They are wrong. This movement is intended to send a message to those Senators: this issue matters to us, and we are prepared to put our money where our mouths are.

Both LEAED and EARN-IT were sponsored by Senator Lindsey Graham, the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Senator Graham faces a challenging election in November, one that he could plausibly lose. His opponent, Jaime Harrison, stands a serious chance of unseating Graham this coming November. With a tight fundraising race between the candidates, we have an opportunity to send a clear message to Graham and his fellow committee members: **don't mess with crypto**.

### Tell me about the legislation

Several excellent pieces have been written on the EARN-IT act [(0)](https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2020/01/earn-it-act-how-ban-end-end-encryption-without-actually-banning-it), [(1)](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/03/earn-it-act-violates-constitution) [(2)](http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2020/03/earn-it-act-here-surprise-it%E2%80%99s-still-bad-news) and on the newer LEAED act [(0)](http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2020/06/there%E2%80%99s-now-even-worse-anti-encryption-bill-earn-it-doesn%E2%80%99t-make-earn-it-bill-ok). These bills work very differently, but have a similar purpose. 

EARN-IT specifies changes to [Section 230](https://www.eff.org/issues/cda230) of the Communications Decency Act, which provides a liability shield for providers who act as "platforms" for users' communications, something that is effectively required in order for providers to do business in the United States. The goal of these changes is to require that companies adhere to standards for detecting child sexual abuse media (CSAM). While this initially seems reasonable, the bill achieves its goal by appointing a government-run technology commission that will decide what tech providers are allowed to deploy in their systems. If this commission, which includes representatives appointed by the U.S. attorney general and Congress, determines that end-to-end encryption does not meet this standard, then large providers such as Facebook and Apple will no longer be allowed to deploy the technology.

LEAED is a more traditional "golden master key" bill. It demands that providers, including those that operate messaging, phone calling, and storage-at-rest systems, design their systems to allow for law enforcement access to data on presentation of a warrant. This means that every existing encryption system will need to be re-designed in order to (a) remove encryption altogether, or (b) add a cryptographic backdoor that providers can use to access encrypted data. In recognition of the fact that technologists [don't know how to build such systems safely](https://www.schneier.com/academic/paperfiles/paper-keys-under-doormats-CSAIL.pdf), the bill establishes a "prize commission" to design the systems it will immediately require.

Each of these bills represents a direct threat to the integrity of communications systems everywhere, and could fundamentally change the balance of power between individual citizens and their government. We oppose them both.

### Why Senator Graham?

Senator Lindey Graham is the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and the primary sponsor of both pieces of legislation. Graham has shown no hesitation about calling for legislation that will effectively end our ability to communicate privately using end-to-end encryption. He feels comfortable in this position for a very simple reason: to date, holding this position has carried no electoral cost.

But Graham is up for election in November 2020. For the first time in more than a decade, Graham faces [tight polling](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/south-carolina/) and a [well-funded opponent](https://www.charlestonchronicle.net/2020/06/04/can-jamie-harrison-beat-lindsey-graham-in-south-carolina/). In this environment, technologist and privacy advocates have an opportunity. If we can show that our opposition to Graham's policies can translate into actual dollars in a competitive political race, then Graham and other U.S. politicians of both parties will have to take note. 

While there's no guarantee that this fundraising campaign will change U.S. politicians' attitudes towards cryptography and communications rights, it will show them that there we are a consticuency, and we're willing to fight for what we believe in.

### What if Graham wins anyway?

He very well might. The point of this campaign is not necessarily to change the outcome of an election. It's to send a clear message that ''privacy is a right that Americans value highly'', and when you threaten our ability to use this technology, there will be electoral consequences. And the technology community that appreciates this isn't powerless: we have our own resources, and can fight our own battles. The larger the financial impact this community makes, the more chance we have to change the underlying political calculus that brought these bills into existence.

### Is this partisan?

All politics is partisan to some extent. Senator Graham is a Republican Senator, and his opponent is a Democrat. But this effort is not intended as a Democratic or a Republican effort. The co-sponsors of EARN-IT include several other Republican and Democratic Senators, all of whom should receive this message. However, none of those co-sponsors are currently facing a challenging re-election campaign.
