## Don't Mess with Crypto

[Donate](dontmesswithcrypto.actblue.com)

This site is dedicated to the proposition that all Americans have the right to communicate privately, and this is a right that we should defend. Today, that right is threatened by two draft bills that are being debated in the U.S. Senate: the [Law Enforcement Access to Encrypted Data](https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/press/rep/releases/graham-cotton-blackburn-introduce-balanced-solution-to-bolster-national-security-end-use-of-warrant-proof-encryption-that-shields-criminal-activity) (LEAED) Act, and the [EARN-IT](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/3398/text) Act. 

These two bills, if passed by Congress and signed into law, would make it difficult impossible for U.S. communications providers to deploy end-to-end encryption technology, such as the technology used in modern phones, and communications systems such as WhatsApp, Signal, Facetime, and Apple iMessage. They would require providers to degrade this technology to the point where it may no longer provide security for our communications.

To the U.S. Senators backing this legislation, the calculation is clear. They believe that the technology and privacy communities are impotent: that we will complain online, and donate to our think tanks, but there will be no electoral consequences for backing a movement to strip Americans of their privacy. They are wrong. This movement is intended to send a message to those Senators: this issue matters to us, and we are prepared to put our money where our mouths are.

Both LEAED and EARN-IT were sponsored by Senator Lindsey Graham, the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Senator Graham faces a challenging election in November, one that he could plausibly lose. His opponent, Jaime Harrison, stands a serious chance of unseating Graham this coming November. With a tight fundraising race between the candidates, we have an opportunity to send a clear message to Graham and his fellow committee members: **don't mess with crypto**.

### Tell me about the legislation


### Why Senator Graham?

### What if this Graham wins anyway?

He very well might. The point of this campaign is not necessarily to change the outcome of an election. It's to send a clear message that ''privacy is a right that Americans value highly'', and when you threaten our ability to use this technology, there will be electoral consequences. And the technology community that appreciates this isn't powerless: we have our own resources, and can fight our own battles. The larger the financial impact this community makes, the more chance we have to change the underlying political calculus that brought these bills into existence.

### Is this partisan?

All politics is partisan to some extent. Senator Graham is a Republican Senator, and his opponent is a Democrat. But this effort is not intended as a Democratic or a Republican effort. The co-sponsors of EARN-IT include several other Republican and Democratic Senators, all of whom should receive this message. However, none of those co-sponsors are currently facing a challenging re-election campaign.
