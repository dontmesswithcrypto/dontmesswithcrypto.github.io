## Don't Mess with Crypto

This site is dedicated to the proposition that all Americans have the right to communicate privately, and this is a right that we should defend. Today, that right is threatened by two draft bills that are being debated in the U.S. Senate: the [Law Enforcement Access to Encrypted Data](https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/press/rep/releases/graham-cotton-blackburn-introduce-balanced-solution-to-bolster-national-security-end-use-of-warrant-proof-encryption-that-shields-criminal-activity) (LEAED) Act, and the [EARN-IT](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/3398/text) Act.
