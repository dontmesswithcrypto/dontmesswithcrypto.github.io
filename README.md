## Don't Mess with Crypto

This site is dedicated to the proposition that all Americans have the right to communicate privately, and this is a right that we should defend. Today, that right is threatened by two draft bills that are being debated in the U.S. Senate: the [Law Enforcement Access to Encrypted Data](https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/press/rep/releases/graham-cotton-blackburn-introduce-balanced-solution-to-bolster-national-security-end-use-of-warrant-proof-encryption-that-shields-criminal-activity) (LEAED) Act, and the [EARN-IT](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/3398/text) Act. 

These two bills, if passed by Congress and signed into law, would make it difficult impossible for U.S. communications providers to deploy end-to-end encryption technology, such as the technology used in modern phones, and communications systems such as WhatsApp, Signal, Facetime, and Apple iMessage. They would require providers to degrade this technology to the point where it may no longer provide security for our communications.

To the U.S. Senators backing this legislation, the calculation is clear. They believe that the technology and privacy communities are impotent: that we will complain online, and donate to our think tanks, but there will be no electoral consequences for backing a movement to strip Americans of their privacy. They are wrong. This movement is intended to send a message to those Senators: this issue matters to us, and we are prepared to put our money where our mouths are.

Both LEAED and EARN-IT were sponsored by Senator Lindsey Graham, the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Senator Graham faces a challenging election in November, one that he could plausibly lose. His opponent, Jaime Harrison, stands a serious chance of unseating Graham this coming November. With a tight fundraising race between the candidates, we have an opportunity to send a clear message to Graham and his fellow committee members: **don't mess with crypto**.
